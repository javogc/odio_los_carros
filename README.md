# odio_los_carros

This is my personal portfolio and react playground. "Odio los carros" translates to "I hate cars" in english. I chose this name for my online presence because I feel it embodies my passion for sustainable transportation in cities and my life as an urban cyclist. I'm currently looking for front-end development posistions, and I'm getting my self familiarized with react through building my personal portfolio with it. Below, you can see journal entries that document my learning process.
